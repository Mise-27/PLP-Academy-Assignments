# Enhanced HTML5 Form — Assignment

This project is a **single HTML file** (`enhanced-form.html`) created as part of an assignment.  
It demonstrates the use of **semantic HTML5 elements**, **tables**, **lists**, **media**, and a **form with validation**.

   - Organized content into sections for clarity.

2. **Lists**
   - Both ordered and unordered lists are included to show structure.

3. **Table**

     - Text fields (first name, last name, username, etc.)
     - Email and phone input with validation patterns
     - Password and confirm password fields
     - Required fields, placeholders, and autocomplete attributes
     - Use of `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for grouping

6. **Validation**
   - Built-in HTML5 validation features:
     - `required`, `minlength`, `placeholder`
     - `autocomplete` for better user experience
     - `pattern` for phone number format
